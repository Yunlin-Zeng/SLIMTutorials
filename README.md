# ML4SeismicTutorials

Tutorial for the ML4Seismic partner meeting


## Guidelines

This serie of tutorial is meant to show simple example of how to use our software. If you are un-familiar with julia and notebook in general, let us know and we will have a walk-thoriugh of the basics

## Package availability

For simplicity, only the most basic packwages are installed in the environment. For any package missing in the notebooks, you can add an extra cell at the top to install the missing package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Pkg1", "Pkg2", ...])
```

where `Pkg1, Pkg2, ..` are the names of the packages to be installed. These packages will be installed in your user environment and will not impact other users.
